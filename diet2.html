<h2>Diet Tips For Weight Gain</h2>
<hr>
<p>Weight gain can be a time-consuming process. But you have to be patient and practice it correctly. Your aim is to put on weight in a healthy manner, not to add unhealthy kilos! So, focus on eating food, but at the right time and in the right quantity, rather than searching for various weight gain diet plans.<br/>
The first step to gain weight is to increase your daily calorie intake. The next section tells you what high-calorie yet healthy foods will help you out.<br/><br/>

<b>What You Need</b><br/>
Eat foods that are rich in calories like pulses, cereals, meat, bread, rice, dry fruits, and nuts.<br/>
<br/>
1.<b> Include Calories In Your Diet</b>:<br/>
Everything we eat has some calorie content. So like we eat food with fewer calories to lose weight, we need to eat food that has more calories to gain weight. You need to take in more than 250 calories daily to add roughly half a kilo to your current weight.<br/><br/>
1) Add vegetables like French beans, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, carrots, lettuce, spinach, asparagus, pumpkins, and eggplants to your diet.<br/>
2) Add a healthy portion of red meat to your diet too. But keep in mind not to overdo it. The aim is to add weight, not cholesterol!<br/>
3) You can even add olive oil in generous quantities to your salads.<br/>
4) Another way to add calories to your diet is by increasing the consumption of dairy products. Don�t cut back on the fat content in your milk. Do not ask for low-fat curd at the store. Make sure you consume a full calorie dairy product.<br/>

Foods rich in calories and proteins easily help people gain and maintain weight as opposed to other foods.
<br/><br/>

2. <b>Increase The Number Of Meals</b>:<br/>
Have six meals a day � three big meals and three small. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner should be heavy and calorie-rich. A heavy dinner adds weight to your body as your metabolism is not as active when you sleep as compared to when you are awake.<br/>

<b>What You Have To Do</b>
<br/>For breakfast, go for a full bowl of cereal, toasted bread with butter, and fruit. If you�re not a big fan of butter, you can always pick cheese or a yummy spread of peanut butter.
For snacks, have nuts and dry fruits, boiled veggies with a dollop of cream, or cheese sandwiches.
You can add some more items to your dessert tray.
And, once in a while, you can give in to your taste buds and indulge in cakes, pizzas, burgers and whatever else your heart fancies.<br/>
<b>Why Does It Work</b><br/>
Frequently eating every three to four hours helps maintain consistent energy levels in your body (2). The meal portions are not big, so there is no fat gain.
<br/>
Speaking of no fat gain, gaining lean muscle mass is something that you should focus on. Here is how to do it.
<br/><br/>
3. <b>High Proteins Along With Calories</b><br/>
Only calories won�t add to your body weight; you need to include the right amount of proteins in your diet. Remember, if you want to put on weight and look fit, you need to build muscles, not flab.
<br/>
<b>What You Need</b><br/>
Eggs, lean meat, fish, skinless chicken, pulses, sprouts, and dairy products that rich sources of proteins. Fish such as tuna and mackerel are rich in oil and are one of the best ways to increase weight.
<br/>
<b>Why Does It Work</b><br/>
Proteins contain amino acids that are the building blocks of muscles. These food sources will give you enough protein necessary to build and tone muscles.
<br/>
So, do you have to ignore fats completely? The answer is no. Consuming fats is not always a bad habit, provided you know the type of fats you are consuming. Here is why you should include healthy fats in your daily diet.
<br/><br/>
4. <b>Healthy Fats</b>:
<br/>Good fats are necessary for muscle growth and production of hormones like testosterone. This is essential for the growth and strength of muscles. This also helps to elevate the metabolic rate, which in turn helps the body lose bad fats and gain good fats. Fats are essential for many vital body functions. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats are considered good fats that can be obtained from nuts, leafy veggies, salmon, flaxseed oil, avocados oil, and many seeds. Healthy fats are also a good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.
<br/>
If you still can�t gain weight, or if you are always traveling and do not have a kitchen to cook your food, you may try some of the weight gain supplements mentioned below.
<br/><br/>
5. <b>Weight Gain Supplements</b><br/>
In some cases, just the diet and exercise may not bring results as quickly as you expect. Another way to go about this is by including some additional supplements in your diet.
<br/>
<b>What You Need</b><br/>
Whey protein is an increasingly popular supplement you can add to your milk or smoothies.
<br/>
<b>Why Does It Work</b><br/>
In this case, adding some supplements like whey protein contributes to the body mass and aid in muscle development (4).
<br/>

<h2>Diet Plan</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>Diet in old age</b>:
<br/>Most people approaching 70s or in 70s experience sudden loss of weight. In such a case, a health care provider prescribes a high-calorie diet for them. The primary objective of the high-calorie diet plans is to put on considerable weight and maintaining it.
<br/>Fibre-rich food options are excellent for gastrointestinal tract changes and constipation problems that are common concerns in the old-age. Soft foods that are easy to chew and high in fat are advised for elderly. Cooked or baked vegetables, fresh fruit and cereals are fibre-rich options for 70-year olds.
Elderly do not experience thirst more often, but fluid in their diet is one of the essentials. Fluids such as milk, tea, coffee, soda and soup help in the prevention of constipation.
Arthritis is a common old-age disease,  though remaining active and engaging in physical activity can ascertain healthy being.
There are several health supplements that help to lower cholesterol and prevent cancer. Discuss with your health care provider before incorporating these into your routine.
<br/><br/><b>Healthy food options</b>:
<br/><b>Protein</b>: Eggs, milk, lean meat, chicken, beans and lentils are excellent protein sources to keep elderly healthy.
Vegetables: Carrots, sweet potato, tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, onions and avocados are the healthy vegetables to be included in the diet plan of a 70-year old.
<br/><b>Fruits</b>: Blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, kiwi, peaches, mango, melon and apples should be incorporated in a dietary regimen.
<br/><b>Pulses and Grains</b>: Lentils, chick peas, brown rice and whole wheat products should also be incorporated in a diet plan for 70-year olds.
<br/><b>Nuts and Seeds</b>: Walnuts, cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds and pumpkin seeds are healthy food options for old-age people.
<br/><b>Fish</b>: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring, tuna and trout are healthy food options for old age..</p>

<h2>Diet Plan</h2>
<hr>
<p>
<b>The plan outlined here will</b>:
<br/>
Reduce your appetite significantly.Make you lose weight quickly, 
without hunger.Improve your metabolic health atthe same time.
Here is a simple 3-step plan to lose weight fast.<br/><br/>

1.<b>Cut Back on Sugars and Starches</b>
The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches(carbs).
When you do that, your hunger levels go down and you end up eating
much fewer calories (1).
Now instead of burning carbs for energy, your body starts feeding 
off of stored fat.<br/>

Another benefit of cutting carbs is that it lowers insulin levels,
causing your kidneys to shed excess sodium and water out of your body. 
This reduces bloat and unnecessary water weight (2, 3).
It is not uncommon to lose up to 10 pounds (sometimes more) in the 
first week of eating this way, both body fat and water weight. 
<br/><br/>
2.<b> Eat Protein, Fat and Vegetables</b>
Each one of your meals should include a protein source, a fat source
and low-carb vegetables.
Constructing your meals in this way will automatically bring your 
carb intake into the recommended range of 20�50 grams per day.<br/>

<strong>Protein Sources</strong>
Meat: Beef, chicken, pork, lamb, etc.
Fish and Seafood: Salmon, trout, shrimp, etc.
Eggs: Whole eggs with the yolk are best.
The importance of eating plenty of protein cannot be overstated.
<br/>
This has been shown to boost metabolism by 80to 100 calories per
day (6, 7, 8).
<br/>
High-protein diets can also reduce cravings andobsessive thoughts 
about food by 60%, reduce the desire for late-night snacking by 
half, and makeyou so full that you automatically eat 441 fewer 
calories per day � just by adding protein to your
diet (9, 10).
<br/>
When it comes to losing weight, protein is the kingof nutrients.Period.
<br/><br/>
<b>Low-Carb Vegetables</b>
Broccoli
Cauliflower
Spinach
Tomatoes
Kale
Brussels sprouts
Cabbage
Swiss chard
Lettuce
Cucumber
Full list here.<br/>
Don�t be afraid to load your plate with these low-carbvegetables. 
You can eat massive amounts of them without going over 20�50 net 
carbs per day.
A diet based mostly on meat and vegetables contains allthe fiber, 
vitamins and minerals you need to be healthy.
<br/><br/>
<b>Fat Sources</b>
Olive oil
Coconut oil
Avocado oil
Butter
Eat 2�3 meals per day. If you find yourself hungry in theafternoon, add
a 4th meal.
<br/>
Don�t be afraid of eating fat, as trying to do both low-carb AND low-fat
at the same time is a recipe for failure. It will make you feel 
miserable and abandon the plan.
<br/>
To see how you can assemble your meals, check out this low-carb meal.
<br/><br/>
3.<b> Lift Weights 3 Times Per Week</b>
You don't need to exercise to lose weight on this plan, but it is 
recommended.
<br/>
The best option is to go to the gym 3�4 times a week. Do a warm-up and 
lift some weights.
<br/>
If you're new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice.
By lifting weights, you will burn lots of calories and prevent your 
metabolism from slowing down, which is a 
common side effect of losing weight (11, 12).
<br/>
<br/>
Studies on low-carb diets show that you can even gain a bit of muscle while
losing significant amounts of body fat (13).
<br/>
If lifting weights is not an option for you, then doing some cardio workouts
like walking, jogging, running, cycling or swimming will suffice.
