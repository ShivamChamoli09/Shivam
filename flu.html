    <h1>FLU</h1>      
<p>It’s a super-contagious virus that can make you feel miserable. Doctors call it influenza. Its symptoms are usually more serious than the sneezes and stuffy nose that
you tend to get from a common cold.</p>
</div>
<h3>Flu Symptoms</h3>You typically start to feel bad quickly instead of over time. You may have a high fever, headache and muscle aches, cough, sore throat, and tiredness. You also might have
a runny or stuffy nose, chills, headache, and nausea or vomiting.</p><h3>How Long Does It Last?</h3>
Most symptoms get better after about 5 days. But sometimes they can last for a week or more. Even if your fever and aches are gone, you can still feel drained for a few weeks.</p><h3>What's the Flu?</h3>It’s a super-contagious virus that can make you feel miserable.

virus landed and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. Flu is more common in winter because people spend more time in close contact with each other, so the virus spreads more easily.</p><h3>Home Remedies</h3>
Get lots of rest. Drink plenty of clear fluids -- water, broth, and sports drinks -- so you don't get dehydrated, too. You can also try a humidifier or saline spray to help
with a stuffy nose. Gargle with salt water for a sore throat.</p><h3>Antiviral Treatment</h3>
These prescription pills work best if you take them within the first 48 hours of feeling bad. The medicine can make your symptoms less severe or shorten them 1 or 2 days.
Antiviral drugs include oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza). Even after 48 hours, they can still help those who have a bad case of the flu,
are over 65, or have a weak immune system.</div>
