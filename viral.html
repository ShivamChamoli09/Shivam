    <h1>VIRAL</h1>      
    <p> Illnesses caused by viruses are among the most frequent causes of fever in adults. 
</p>
  </div>
  
Common symptoms can include a 

<div style="color:red">-runny nose</div>
<div style="color:red">-sore throat </div>
<div style="color:red">-cough</div>
<div style="color:red">-hoarseness</div>
<div style="color:red">-muscle aches</div>

Viruses also may cause diarrhea, vomiting, or an upset stomach. For the most part, these viral illnesses will improve simply with time.

A viral fever is rarely a cause for concern and in most cases, it clears without any medical intervention. However, it is not

easy to differentiate between a bacterial infection and a viral fever as they share many of the same symptoms, which is why it is important to consult a 

doctor if your temperature reaches 102 

degrees Fahrenheit or if it shows no signs of abatement after 48 hours.</pre>
