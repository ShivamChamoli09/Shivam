    <h1>ALLERGY</h1>      
<p>If you’re allergic to pollen, you may get a break when the weather gets cold. But if you have indoor allergies such as mold and dust mites, you may notice your<br> allergy symptoms more during winter, when you spend more time inside.</p>
</div>

<h3>Causes</h3>When it gets cold and your furnace kicks on, it sends dust, mold spores, and insect parts into the air. They can get into your nose and launch a reaction.

Some common indoor allergy triggers are:

Dust mites . These microscopic bugs flourish in mattresses and bedding. When their droppings and remains become airborne, they can cause allergy symptoms.
Mold. This fungus thrives in damp, humid areas such as basements and bathrooms. When mold spores get into the air, they can trigger allergy symptoms.
Animals. Most people are not allergic to animal fur, but rather to a protein found in the pet dander, saliva, and urine.
